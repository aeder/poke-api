Technical test: PokeAPI

Goal: Create a Poke-berries statistics API.

General rules:

- Commit your changes to a public repository in GitHub.

- Add a README.md with instructions to run the code.

Support the following endpoints

GET /allBerryStats

Response: {

    "berries_names": [...],

    "min_growth_time": "" // time, int

    "median_growth_time": "", // time, float

    "max_growth_time": "" // time, int

    "variance_growth_time": "" // time, float

    "mean_growth_time": "", // time, float

    "frequency_growth_time": "", // time, {growth_time: frequency, ...}

}

This endpoint should consume an external API to get the proper info, here

is the documentation page: https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#berries

- The data must be human-readable.

- Use environment variables for configuration.

- The response must include the content-type header (application/json)

- Functions must be tested with pytest.

For extra points:

- Upload and deploy the solution to a free cloud service like Heroku.

- Use a Python library (example: Matplotlib) to create a Histogram graph and display the image in a plain html.
